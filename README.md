## 🌟 Overview

**Amethyst** is an intelligent, modular desktop assistant designed to replace tedious manual interaction with natural, conversational commands. Instead of clicking through menus and opening apps one by one, you simply type or speak — and Amethyst handles it.

It combines the raw power of **C++** for system-level operations with the intelligence of **Python** for AI responses and voice recognition, all wrapped in a clean, mobile-inspired dark-theme GUI built with **Tkinter**.

---

## ❗ The Problem

Traditional desktop environments still force users to:

| Problem | Reality |
|---|---|
| 📝 Managing notes | Requires opening a separate application |
| ⏰ Setting reminders | Involves multiple steps and menus |
| 📂 Opening apps | Requires manual navigation or searching |
| 🎙️ Voice interaction | Usually cloud-dependent and privacy-invasive |
| 🤖 Smart responses | Existing tools lack deep system integration |

**Amethyst solves all of this from a single chat window.**

---

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 💬 Natural Language Input | Type commands the way you speak — no rigid syntax |
| 🎙️ Offline Voice Recognition | Speak directly to the assistant using Vosk (no internet needed) |
| 📝 Notes Manager | Add and view persistent notes without leaving the chat |
| ⏰ Reminder Manager | Set time-based reminders; get pop-up notifications when they're due |
| 🖥️ System Automation | Open 15+ apps (VS Code, Chrome, Excel, Spotify, etc.) by voice or text |
| 🤖 AI Fallback | Unrecognized commands are answered intelligently via Groq (LLaMA 3.1) |
| 🎨 Modern Dark UI | Mobile-inspired chat bubbles, teal accents, auto-scroll |

## 🏗️ System Architecture

Amethyst follows a clean **5-layer architecture**, where every layer has a clearly defined responsibility:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         User Interface Layer            │
│         Tkinter GUI (Python)            │
│  [Text Input]           [Voice Input]   │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
               │
┌──────────────▼──────────────────────────┐
│       Command Processor (C++)           │
│       Parse & Route Commands            │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
               │
┌──────────────▼──────────────────────────┐
│          Manager Modules Layer          │
│  [Notes]  [Reminders]  [System Cmds]   │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
               │
┌──────────────▼──────────────────────────┐
│           AI & Voice Layer              │
│  [AI Module (Python)]  [Vosk Voice]    │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
               │
┌──────────────▼──────────────────────────┐
│          Data Storage Layer             │
│    notes.txt        reminders.txt       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Data Flow

```
User Input (text/voice)
    → GUI sends to C++ backend
        → CommandProcessor analyzes & routes
            → Module executes action
                → Response returned to GUI
```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Technology | Role | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **C++** | Core backend engine | Fast execution, direct OS access, process control |
| **Python** | AI, Voice & GUI | Rich ecosystem, easy library integration |
| **Tkinter** | Graphical interface | Lightweight, native look, no extra dependencies |
| **Vosk** | Offline speech recognition | No internet needed, privacy-friendly, lightweight model |
| **Groq API (LLaMA 3.1)** | AI fallback responses | Fast inference, conversational intelligence |

## 🧩 Modules

### 🧠 CommandProcessor
The brain of Amethyst. Every input — typed or spoken — passes through here.

| Responsibility | Detail |
|---|---|
| Receives input | Text or voice, from any source |
| Normalizes text | Converts to lowercase for consistent matching |
| Detects intent | Keyword matching across all modules |
| Routes command | Delegates to the right manager |
| AI fallback | If nothing matches, asks the AI |

---

### 📝 Notes Manager
Save information instantly without leaving the chat.

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | User types `add note buy groceries` |
| 2 | Note is appended to `notes.txt` |
| 3 | Notepad opens automatically with updated notes |
| 4 | Notes persist across all sessions |

---

### ⏰ Reminder Manager
Set reminders and get notified via Windows pop-ups.

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | User types `add reminder 2026-06-25 18:00 \| Call mom` |
| 2 | Saved to `reminders.txt` with timestamp |
| 3 | System checks after every command |
| 4 | Windows `MessageBoxA` pop-up fires when due |
| 5 | Completed reminders are auto-removed |

---

### 🖥️ System Command Manager
Control your desktop through words.

| Category | Supported Apps |
|---|---|
| 🔧 Windows Built-in | Calculator, Notepad, File Explorer, Task Manager, Paint, Settings, Control Panel, CMD, PowerShell |
| 💻 Development Tools | VS Code, Dev-Cpp, Cursor |
| 📊 Office Suite | Word, PowerPoint, Excel |
| 🌐 Other Apps | Browser, LinkedIn, Spotify, ChatGPT |

> **Security:** Only predefined commands are accepted — no arbitrary code execution.

---

### 🤖 AI Integration
When no command matches, Amethyst falls back to an AI response.

```
C++ (control) → spawns Python subprocess → Groq API (LLaMA 3.1-8b) → response piped back → displayed in GUI
```

- Input is safely escaped before passing to shell
- Output is captured via pipes with `<END_OF_RESPONSE>` marker
- Model: `llama-3.1-8b-instant` via Groq

---

### 🎙️ Voice Input
Speak naturally — Amethyst listens offline.

| Property | Detail |
|---|---|
| Engine | Vosk (Kaldi-based) |
| Model | `vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15` |
| Sample Rate | 16,000 Hz |
| Duration | 5 seconds per listen |
| Internet | ❌ Not required |
| Privacy | ✅ Fully local |
